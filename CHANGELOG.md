## [1.0.0] - 2025-06-05

### Added
- **Complete 68000 to x86_64 assembly conversion**
  - Converted Motorola 68000 assembly program to x86_64 architecture
  - Implemented System V ABI calling conventions
  - Proper register mapping and stack frame management

- **Security Enhancements**
  - Non-executable stack protection (`section .note.GNU-stack noexec`)
  - Arithmetic overflow detection using hardware flags
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Denial-of-service prevention with attempt limiting
  - Improved input buffer management

- **Comprehensive Testing Framework**
  - Dual testing approach (standalone + assembly integration)
  - Unit tests for register_adder function
  - Boundary testing for edge cases
  - Security feature validation
  - Integration testing for complete workflow

- **Professional Build System**
  - Complete Makefile with multiple targets
  - Automated function extraction script
  - Test execution automation
  - Clean build artifact management

- **Documentation**
  - Detailed README with technical specifications
  - Comprehensive test plan documentation
  - Inline code comments and explanations
  - Architecture comparison charts

### Security Features
- **Buffer Overflow Protection**: Enhanced input handling prevents buffer overflow attacks
- **Stack Execution Prevention**: NX bit prevents code injection via stack
- **Arithmetic Overflow Detection**: Hardware-based overflow checking prevents integer overflow exploits
- **Input Validation**: Robust input checking prevents malformed data processing
- **DoS Prevention**: Attempt limiting prevents infinite loop attacks

### Technical Improvements
- **Memory Safety**: Proper stack frame management and memory access patterns
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of invalid input with user feedback
- **Performance**: Optimized assembly implementation with efficient register usage
- **Portability**: Standard System V ABI compliance for broad x86_64 compatibility

### Testing Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: 15+ test cases covering basic functionality
- **Boundary Tests**: Edge case testing with maximum/minimum values
- **Security Tests**: Validation of all security features
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end program workflow testing
- **Regression Tests**: Compatibility verification with original 68k behavior

## [Unreleased]

### Planned Features
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS)
- GUI demonstration interface
- Performance benchmarking tools
- Additional architecture targets (ARM64, RISC-V)
- Internationalization support

### Under Consideration
- Static analysis integration
- Fuzzing test automation
- Docker containerization
- CI/CD pipeline setup

## Version History

### v1.0.0 (2025-06-05)
- Initial release with complete 68k to x86_64 conversion
- Full security enhancement implementation
- Comprehensive testing framework
- Professional documentation

---

## Migration Notes

### From Original 68000 Version
- **Register Usage**: D1/D2 parameters now use RDI/RSI registers
- **System Calls**: TRAP #15 replaced with C library function calls
- **Memory Model**: 32-bit addresses expanded to 64-bit pointers
- **Stack Operations**: Enhanced with security-conscious stack management
- **Error Handling**: Significantly improved with modern error recovery

### Security Migrations
- **Input Handling**: All input now validated before processing
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Overflow detection added to all calculations
- **Memory Access**: Bounds checking implemented where applicable
- **Stack Usage**: Non-executable stack marking for injection prevention
